# QuizCreator
It's a Java application with Maven for generating quizes for users.

Questions that are added are saved on local machine(You can buy a online remote database to avoid that).
Questions can be added, edited, removed, view.
You can also save a CSV or JSON file of the questions to the application.
Admin can set test settings for the users like no. of questions, marks, and minimum marks.
It also has a log feature which creates a log for the steps that are going in the background while running.

In future,  I will be doing some changes to this repository adding more features and updating the GUI of it for which I am studying further.
